#Recipe book

## Assignment
In this project, we will write code to make our own simple recipe book.
The goal is to have the program show us a list of available recipes for a chosen category of food.
Once a recipe is selected, it will be shown in the terminal.

## Concepts

We will review inheritance, and see how we can read data from files to
use it in our applications. To do this, we will use ye olde way of reading files.
We will also show how java.nio simplifies all of this.
